<p>What about you?
How many people are doing microservices?
How many people are using Java 8? Spring Boot?
What about Lagom/Play, Dropwizard, or Vert.x?</p></aside></section>
<section class="image" style="background-image: url(images/venice.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#History">Wikipedia</a>, the term "microservice" was first used a
common architecture style at a workshop of software architects near Venice in May 2011. In May 2012, the same group
decided "microservices" was a more appropriate name.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Rodgers introduced the term "Micro-Web-Services" during a presentation at Cloud Computing Expo in 2005.
Juval Löwy had similar precursor ideas about classes being granular services, as the next evolution of Microsoft architecture in 2007.
"Services are composed using Unix-like pipelines (the Web meets Unix = true loose-coupling). Services can call services
(+multiple language run-times). Complex service-assemblies are abstracted behind simple URI interface. Any service, at any
granularity, can be exposed."</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>That&#8217;s the real history. Nevertheless, James Lewis, Martin Fowler get a lot of credit, as does Adrian Dockcroft and Joe Walnes.</p>
<p>James Lewis presented some of the ideas behind microservices in March 2012 at 33rd Degree in Kraków. His talk
was called Microservices - Java, the Unix Way. <a href="https://github.com/fredgeorge">Fred George</a> is credited with for sharing
similar ideas at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft">Adrian Cockcroft</a>, who was at Netflix at the time, describing this architecture
as "fine grained SOA". He pioneered the style at web scale, as did Joe Walnes, Dan North, Evan Bottcher and Graham Tackley.</p>
<p>Martin Fowler and James Lewis wrote an article titled simply <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a>
on March 25, 2014. Years later, this is still considered the definitive article that defines microservices.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Technology have traditionally been organized into technology layers: UI team, database team, operations team.
When teams are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project taking time and
budgetary approval.</p>
<p>A smart team will optimise around this and choose the lesser of two evils; forcing the logic into whichever application
they have access to. This is an example of <a href="http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html">Conway&#8217;s Law</a> in action.</p></aside></section>

<p>"Do one thing and do it well."</p>
<aside role="note"><p>The philosophy of a microservices architecture essentially equals to the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well".</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to work on small "do one thing well" services. No single program represents the whole application, so services
can change frameworks (or even languages) without a massive cost. As long as the services use a language agnostic protocol (HTTP or lightweight messaging),
can application can be written in several different platforms - Java, Ruby, Node, Go, .NET, etc. - without issues.</p>
<p>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers and containers have made it easy to deploy microservices. All the technologies needed to support a monolith
(e.g. load balancing, discovery, process monitoring) are provided by the PaaS, outside of your container. Deployment effort becomes
close to zero.</p></aside></section>
<section class="future image" style="background-image: url(images/future.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>The Future?</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>Are microservices the future?</p>
<p>Architecture decisions are usually only evident several years after you make them. Microservices have been successful
at companies like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll be successful for
your organization. Component boundaries are hard to define. If you&#8217;re not able to create your components cleanly,
you&#8217;re just shifting complexity from inside a component to the connections between the components. Also, team
capabilities is something to consider. A poor team will always create a poor system.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>You shouldn&#8217;t start with a microservices architecture. Instead begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.</p></blockquote><figcaption>Martin Fowler <cite>March 2014</cite></figcaption></figure></section>
<section><figure class="image"><img src="images/spring-boot.png" alt="Spring Boot" width="200"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>However, if you have a monolith and want to migrate to microservices, you should definitely check out Spring Boot.
It&#8217;s a project that&#8217;s simplified Spring configurations so they barely exist anymore. With smart defaults and auto-configuration,
it allows you to create highly configurable applications that deploy easily.</p>

<aside role="note"><p>Stormpath&#8217;s microservices implementation is based on <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>

served up using <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> and have been from day one.</p>
<p>Had to rewrite a lot of Samza to work because it was based on Yarn for deployment and used Kafka for its coordination. Changed
it to use Spring Boot and Zookeeper. Samza is better than Spring&#8217;s Kafka consumer because it has local storage. Spring&#8217;s
Kafka consumer support didn&#8217;t exist when Stormpath was building their system.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Stormpath joined forces with Okta in February. Why? So we could move faster!</p>
<p>Okta provides an API service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data,
and connect them with one or multiple applications.  We make user account management a lot easier, more secure, and
infinitely scalable. To get started <a href="http://developer.okta.com">register for a free account</a>.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="image"><img src="images/spring-boot-in-3-weeks.png" alt="How We Migrated Our Backend to Spring Boot in 3 Weeks" width="500"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>Our application was a traditional Spring app secured by Apache Shiro and configured with both XML and Java Config. When we added Spring Boot, it didn&#8217;t replace Spring of course (since Spring Boot is built on top of Spring), but it simplified much of our architecture by adding a layer that helps automate configuration and deployment while making it easier to implement features, as well as prime our architecture for modular microservices (more on that later).</p>
<p>Because we have thousands of customers in production and are constantly developing new features, we did extensive testing to make sure everything still worked as expected. We also built some custom Spring Boot Starters, including a nifty one for real-time stream messaging with Apache Samza. And even though our software stack is a few years old and involves a lot of business edge cases and intricate code paths, we were able to make the transition in just three weeks.</p>
<p>In the process, we tried to use as much of the Spring Boot and Spring Cloud ecosystem to remove as much custom code as possible. Spring Boot allows us to do that in a clean, plugin-oriented way. Here&#8217;s what we did:</p>
<ul><li><span class="primary">XML Config to Java Config</span></li><li><span class="primary">Boot Dictates Where Your Config Files Reside</span></li><li><span class="primary">Auto-Configuration in Spring Boot</span></li></ul>
<p>The Spring Boot Starter ecosystem gives us a huge amount of out-of-the-box functionality that traditionally we used to build ourselves. Instead of defining beans and wiring them ourselves, we’re using Spring Boot Starters wherever possible.</p>
<p>We use the ecosystem integrations for Zookeeper, Kafka, Cassandra, JMS messaging, SMTP mail servers and many others. Historically, we’ve had to build, integrate and configure these services ourselves, but now we just drop in the necessary starter dependency, and boom: the starter is enabled and auto-configured!</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p><strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong></p>
<p>A JWT is a secure and trustworthy standard for token authentication. JWTs allow you to digitally sign information
(referred to as claims) with a signature and can be verified at a later time with a secret signing key.</p>
<p>In this example, Section 1 is a header which describes the token. Section 2 is the payload, which contains the JWT’s claims, and Section 3 is the signature hash that can be used to verify the integrity of the token (if you have the secret key that was used to sign it).</p>
<p>The claims tell you, at minimum:</p>
<p>Who this person is and the URI to their user resource (the sub claim)
What this person can access with this token (the scope claim)
When the token expires. Your API should be using this when it verifies the token.</p></aside></section>

<section class="white"><h2>Microservices with JHipster</h2><figure class="image"><img src="images/jhipster-microservices-architecture.png" alt="JHipster Microservice Architecture" width="400"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>In this diagram, green represents JHipster-generated components while blue are the registry and console applications.</p>
<p>You first generate a gateway that handles web traffic and serves up an Angular UI.</p>
<p>The JHipster Registry is a standalone application that you install, rather than generate. All microservices register with this application and get their configuration from it. This application is based on Netflix’s Eureka and Spring Cloud Config.</p>
<p>Microservices are JHipster-generated stateless applications that handle REST requests.</p>
<p>To monitor this architecture you can use JHipster Console, which is based on the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Automation and orchestration are key for deployment.</p>
<p>Define your exit criteria (e.g. maximum time for a request to execute) before implementing your microservices infrastructure. You’re likely going to have to custom build some things, so be prepared for that. Trial a few different platforms and then pick the one that meets your criteria and is the easiest to develop with. Don’t develop half of your system on one platform and then try moving to another.</p>
<p>Make sure and record the request id in all logging events for traceability.</p>
<p>If you have less than 20 people, start with a monolith, but build in async messaging asap. Use it for things like mail, notifications, logging, and archiving. Debugging, deployment, logging is much easier with a monolith.</p>
